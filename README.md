From Coin Box to Codebase: When ₹1 Meant 1 Minute

🎥 Watch the Retro Coin Phone Booth in action → [Click Here](https://srivanipaspunoor1234.github.io/Retro-Coin-Phone/)

# Project Overview

Before smartphones and unlimited talk time, making a phone call meant finding a ₹1 coin, standing by a public coin phone, and watching every second tick away 

This project recreates that nostalgic experience as a web-based Retro Public Coin Phone Booth using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Instead of building just another web project, this simulates the real behavior of coin-box phones, including call timing, number entry, and call states.

# Features

 → ₹1 = 1 minute of talk time
 → Dial numbers using the keypad
 → '*' to clear the number or end the call
 → '#' to start/confirm the call
 → Realistic call states: Before Call → Call Connected → Call Ended
 → Clear UI flow inspired by classic coin-box phones
 → Prevents invalid number entries — only Indian mobile numbers starting with 6, 7, 8, or 9 are     allowed
